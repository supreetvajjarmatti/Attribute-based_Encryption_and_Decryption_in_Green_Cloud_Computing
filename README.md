# Attribute-based_Encryption_and_Decryption_in_Green_Cloud_Computing

# Abstract -
To reduce a user’s decryption cost and protect private information from being leaked, the green cloud networks help to reduce the user’s cost. However, this method is not efficient for the cloud server in the green cloud networks. So, we have proposed account recyclable utilization of resources for the  cloud server, which put forward a new and secure approach to reduce the total overhead of the cloud server. Another approach we have proposed in our schemes, outsourcing the decryption of the attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to the cloud server. 
However, the cloud server needs to repeat the outsourced decryption service of the same ciphertexts for distinct users satisfying the same access policy. So, compared with the existing ABEOD schemes, our total overhead of the cloud server is independent of the number of users who satisfy an access policy and request the outsourcing decryption service. Finally, we extend our approach to an RCCA-secure ABE-OD scheme.
